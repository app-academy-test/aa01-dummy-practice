# Choose Your Branch!

This repo contains different versions of the starter code for **aa01-dummy-practice**,
with each version stored in a program-specific branch. To download or clone the
correct branch, follow the instructions for your specific program below.

## `degit` the branch

This is the most straightforward way to clone the project. Simply run the
following command in the directory where you want the project to appear:

```sh
npx degit app-academy-test/aa01-dummy-practice#full-time aa01-dummy-practice
```

```sh
npx degit app-academy-test/aa01-dummy-practice#part-time aa01-dummy-practice
```

> **Note:** The first time you run `npx degit`, you will likely be asked if you
> want to install `degit`. Go ahead and install it.  

Once the repo is cloned, run `cd aa01-dummy-practice && git init` to initialize the
project as a git repository that you can connect to your personal GitHub
account.
